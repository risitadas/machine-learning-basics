Supervised Learning
	= modelling


1) Classification
	= assigning a category

	* will this customer stop its subcription? yes/no
	* is this mole cancerous? yes/no
	* what kind of wine is that? red/white/rosé
	* what flower is that? rose/tulip/lily/carnation

2) Regression
	= assigning a continuous variable

	* how much will this stock be worth?
	* what is this exoplanet's mass?
	* how tall will this child be as an adult?


Classification vs Regression:

* Regression = continuous
	
	^ any value within a finite(height) or infinite(time) interval
		eg: 20 °F,20.1 °F,20.01 °F...
	
* Classification = category

	^ one of few specific values
		eg: cold, mild, hot
