Limits OF Machine Learning:

1. Data ---> a) lack of data
	     b) lack of good data

 Data quality - 
	^ garbage in garbage out
	^ output quality depends on input quality

 Quality assurance - 
	^ high quality data requires:
		* data analysis
		* review of outliers
		* domain expertise
		* documentation

2. Deterministic Problems
	-ML is stochastic, not deterministic

3. Ethics

4. Misapplication ----> * P-hacking
		       * Scope of the analysis

5. Interpretability and Explainability - 
	* transparency to increase trust, clarity, and understanding
	* use cases: business adoption, regulatory oversight, minimizing bias

6. Beware - 
	* dont blindly trust your model
	* awareness is key
	* pay attention to your data

ml models are only good as the data you give it 


other limitations include :

* each narrow application needs to be specially trained
* require large amounts of hand-crafted, structured training data
* learning must generally be supervised: Training data must be tagged
* require lengthy offline/ batch training
* not to learn incrementally or interactively, in real time



Explainable AI 

Black box				Explainable AI
# deep learning				# traditional machine learning
# better for "what?"			# better for "why?" (prediction,inference) 
# highlt accurate predictions		# understandable by humans
