Three types :

1) Reinforcement Learning
	 * training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or 
		punishing undesired ones
	 * learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, 
		take actions and learn through trial and error

2) Supervised Learning
	* an approach to creating artificial intelligence (AI), where a computer algorithm
		is trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output
	* turns data into real, actionable insights
	* it enables organizations to use data to understand and prevent unwanted outcomes
		or boost desired outcomes for their target variable

3) Unsupervised Learning
	* the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify patterns in 
		data sets containing data points that are neither classified nor labeled
	* in reality,data doesn't always come with labels
		^ requires manual labor to label
		^ labels are unknown
	* no labels: model is unsupervised and finds its own patterns




Training Data :
	*training data - existing data to learn from
	*training a model - when a model is built from training data


Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning:

* Supervised learning
	^training data is "labeled"
* Unsupervised learning
	^training data only has features
	^useful for:
		*Anomaly detection
		*Clustering, eg., dividing data into groups




Applications:

	MACHINE LEARNING:
		1. SUPERVISED LEARNING
			* Classification
			* Regression

		2. UNSUPERVISED LEANING
			* Clustering
			* Anomaly detection
			* Association
