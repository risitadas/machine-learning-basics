Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* the ability for computers to understand the meaning of human language

* combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, 
	machine learning, and deep learning models

* together,these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text 
	or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment

* plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, 
	increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes

* drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, 
	respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time

* two main phases: data preprocessing 
		   algorithm development


techniques and methods used in NLP :
1) Bag of words -
	* counting the number of times important words appear in each piece of text
	* n-grams are a foundational way to make features from text, 
		n-grams count the sequence of words and n indicates how many word(s) a sequence contains
	* as we increase the value of n, the occurrences of n-grams decreases
	* limitations - word counts dont help us consider synonyms
		eg: "blue"
		    a) "sky blue"	b) "aqua" 	c) "cerulean"
		      - want to group as a single feature
	* solution : Word embeddings ---> create features that group similar words
				     ---> features have a mathematical meaning

2) Parsing
3) Word segmentation
4) Sentence breaking
5) Morphological segmentation
6) Stemming
7) Word sense disambiguation
8) Sentiment Analysis:
	*methodology for quantifying how positive or negative the emotion expressed by a segment of text is
	*it is often used for automatically categorizing customer feedback messages or product reviews


Used for?
* text classification
* text extraction
* machine translation
* natural language generation



Applications and Benefits: 
* improved accuracy and efficiency of documentation
* language translation
* useful for personal assistants such as Alexa, by enabling it to understand spoken word
* enables an organization to use chatbots for customer support
* easier to perform sentiment analysis
* provides advanced insights from analytics that were previously unreachable due to data volume



Challenges:
* precision
* tone of voice and inflection
* evolving use of language



Deep Learning:
* two types of problems ---> 1. computer vision
			     2. natural language processing

*why deep learning?
	1. complex problems
	2. automatic feature extraction
	3. lots of data
