Improving Performance


Machine Learning Workflow :


3. Train model ----> 4. Evaluate ---> is performance good enough?---> yes ---? model
	^						|
	<----------------------------------------------no	


Several options :

* Dimensionality reduction
	^ denotes the number of features in your data 
	^ means reducing the number of features
	
examples:

i) Correlation: some features carry similar information
	* keep only one feature
		eg: height and shoe size---> height
	* collapse multiple features into one underlying feature
		eg: height and weight---> body mass index


* Hyperparameter tuning
	^ is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters 
		for a learning algorithm
	^ is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process

examples:

* SVM algorithm hyperparameters:
	^ kernel:"linear"--->"poly"		^degree
	^C					^gamma
	^shrinking 		^coef0 		^tol

	

* Ensemble methods
	^ techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce 
		improved results
	^ produces more accurate solutions than a single model would


data -----> model A ----->output A --- \
data -----> model B ----->output B ----- > final output
data -----> model C ----->output C --- /

i) Classification
	(use voting)
data -----> model A ----->accepted --------\
data -----> model B ----->not accepted ----- > accepted
data -----> model C ----->accepted ------- /

ii) Regression
	(use averaging)
data -----> model A ----->5 --- \
data -----> model B ----->8 ----- > 5.67
data -----> model C ----->4 --- /
