Unsupervised learning:
 = no target column
	^ no guidance
	^ looks at the whole dataset
	^ tries to detect patterns


1) Clustering Models

	* K-Means:
		^ specify the number of clusters

	* DBSCAN(density-based spayial clustering of applications with noise):
		^ specify what constitutes a cluster

2) Anomaly detection

	* Anomaly detection = detecting outliers
	* Outliers = observations that differ from the rest

Some anomaly detection use cases:
* discovering devices that fail faster or last longer
* discover fraudsters that manage trick the system
* discover patients that resist a fatal disease


3) Association

	*finding events that happen together
	*often used for market basket analysis
