Computer Vision

* helps computers see and understand the content of digital images
* is necessary to enable, for example, self-driving cars

eg:
Manufacturers such as Tesla, BMW, Volvo, and Audi use multiple cameras to acquire images
from the environment so that their self-driving cars can detect objects, 
lane markings, and traffic signs to safely drive


Image Data:
to understand how it works, 
* we first need to find out what image data looks like
* an image is made up of pixels
* these pixels contain information about color and intensity
	 # for a grayscale pixelated image:
		each pixel's intensity can be represented by a number between 0 and 255

	 # for coloured images :
		generally stored in the RGB system
		RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue 
		Each image can be thought of as being represented by three rasters, 
			one for each color channel
		This means that you need three times the amount of data to store a 
			color image compared to a grayscale one
		So, digital images can actually be seen as a bunch of numbers


Applications :

* Facial recognition
* Self-driving vehicles
* Automatic detection of tumors in CT scans
* Deep fake
