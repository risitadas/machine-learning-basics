Deep Learning:

* type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates 
	the way humans gain certain types of knowledge
* important element of data science, which includes statistics and predictive modeling
* AKA: Neutral Networks
	^ basic unit : neurons(nodes)
* special area of Machine Learning
* requires more data
* best when inputs are images or text

for example: Predicting Box Office Revenue

budget and advertisements -----------> O ----------->spend ---\
advertisements and star powet -------> O ------->awareness -----> O box office revenue
budget,advertisements, and timing ---> O ---->distribution ---/

* Neutral Networks are much larger
* Deep Learning : neutral network with many neutrons
* can solve complex problems

When to use deep learning?

	* lots of data
	* access to processing power
	* lack of domain knowledge
	* complex problems :
		a) computer vision
		b) natural language processing
